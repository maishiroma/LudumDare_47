# Ludume Dare 47 Game Jam
Welcome! This is the page for my submission to the Ludume Dare 47th Game Jam (Oct 2-5)! The theme for this one is _stuck in a loop_. 

With this one being one of my first Ludume Dares, let alone game jams, I went with a fairly simple game idea that I thought could be done in a weekend...

    <summary>Spoiler Alert</summary>

I was wrong. VERY wrong.
</details>

Regardless, I got something working and in a pretty fun state. So without further adieu, here is my very first submission!

## Hunger Pains
![Gameplay Peak](./Documentation/Assets/Game_Dev_Summary.gif)

__Hunger Pains__ is a simple action game where the player is tasked to survive as long as possible on the sushi conveyor belt from hungry customers. Go for the high score, while overcoming the steadily increasing challenges of the customers! You know what they say, the longer people don't eat, the more desperate they will get...

## Win Conditions
Survice from the onslaught of chopsticks that are trying to pick you up!

## Lose Conditions
Get taken by a chopstick and..._gulp_ eaten!

## Developer Notes
This game in its current state is complete in terms of content for the Game Jam. However, there are a multitude of Good-to-Haves that I would like to go back to someday, which most of them are due to time constraints. These include:
- Properly cleaning and pruning the codebase
- Documenting all of the code that is used in this game
- Adding in the second challenge that was scrapped due to time constraints

## Controls
- WASD: Move
